<h1>Discord bot for fetching OpenDota API!</h1>
<p>Discord with 3 commands(up to now!) such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>/hero</b>: Send embed with short information about hero from Dota 2. Example: <img src='https://i.imgur.com/FHitNQq.png'</li>
<li><b>/player</b>: Send embed with information about player with links to profile on Steam and OpenDota. Example: <img src='https://i.imgur.com/c8UiSPa.png'></li>
<li><b>/playerheroes</b>: Send embed with top 5 heroes of chosen player. Example: <img src='https://i.imgur.com/sH9ZBq0.png'></li>
<br>
<p>It's first version of bot with only 3 commands, but I plan to add more commands in future!</p>
<h1>Instalation</h1>
<p>Run <b><i>npm install</b></i> to have all dependencies -> Create config.json file with your ClientId, GuildId and token, to make bot workable. And of course firstly create your's bot on the official Discord dev page</p>
